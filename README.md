# Configuring hector quad-rotor with Crazyflie parameters

This repository is simply the [hector quad-rotor](http://wiki.ros.org/hector_quadrotor) to simulate the parameters of the [Bitcraze Crazyflie](http://www.bitcraze.se/crazyflie/).
The simulation uses a standard PS3 controller and can be started by calling a launchfile:    
```roslaunch hector_quadrotor_demo outdoor_flight_gazebo.launch```


My next steps are:
Add a module for the [Myo Armband](https://www.thalmic.com/en/myo/)
